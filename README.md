# Clean Architecture Flutter App

![App Architecture](assets/FLutterbloc.png)

This Flutter app demonstrates a clean architecture pattern using the following features:

## Features
- **Splash Screen**: Provides an initial loading screen for the app.
- **Login Screen**: Includes user authentication functionality.
- **Home Screen**: Displays the main content of the app.
- **Details Screen**: Shows detailed information based on user interaction.
- **Logout Button**: Allows users to safely log out of the app.

## App Architecture
The app follows the **Clean Architecture** principle, dividing the codebase into distinct layers:
1. **Common**: Shared utilities and constants.
2. **Data**: Handles API requests, local data storage, and repository implementation.
3. **Domain**: Contains use cases and entities.
4. **Presentation**: Manages UI and state using **BLoC** (Business Logic Component) pattern.

## State Management
The app uses **flutter_bloc** and **bloc** packages for state management, ensuring predictable and scalable application state.

## Packages Used
- [`flutter_bloc`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc): State management library.
- [`bloc`](https://pub.dev/packages/bloc): Core library for business logic components.
- [`equatable`](https://pub.dev/packages/equatable): Simplifies equality checks in Dart objects.
- [`http`](https://pub.dev/packages/http): HTTP client for making REST API calls.
- [`hive`](https://pub.dev/packages/hive): Lightweight and fast key-value database.
- [`hive_flutter`](https://pub.dev/packages/hive_flutter): Integration of Hive with Flutter.
- [`fluttertoast`](https://pub.dev/packages/fluttertoast): Displays toast messages for user feedback.
- [`cached_network_image`](https://pub.dev/packages/cached_network_image): Efficiently caches and displays images from the network.
